EverythingBitesized: Whitepaper 
(Currency called Sugar DropZ or $DRPZ as a market ticker)

Welcome to the official whitepaper for the Sugar DropZ ($DRPZ) token which unlike most proposed projects not only has real utility but is already tied to an already thriving project: www.YouTube.com/@EverythingBitesized (more info on my channel and how it pertains to the project as the paper progresses on). 

Token Economics:
Original Tokens Minted - 19,000,000 $DRPZ

Founder’s Tokens - 150,000 $DRPZ (only 0.789473684% of total supply will be in my personal long term bag)

Marketing Fund - 1,000,000 $DRPZ (5.26315789% of total supply)

Development Fund - 2,000,000 $DRPZ (10.52% of total supply)

Early Investors - 2,000,000 $DRPZ (10.52%) (Limit of 50,000-100,000 per person to be paid over a period of time in installments to avoid a rug pull situation and too much wealth in too little hands)

Early Adopters (People like yourselves if you take part soon) - 1,000,000 $DRPZ (5.26% of total supply)

Air DropZ (or as will be refered to: 'Sugar DropZ') - 10,000,000 $DRPZ (52.63% of the total supply will be given out to the general public including yourselves in free air DropZ over the course of the projects roll out, release, and continued use into the future

Project Funds - 2,000,000 $DRPZ (10.52% of total supply) for the website to run smoothly and sold to people directly through the website (using fiat cash) for use on site and provide a source of liquidity for exit and entry onto the site from 'real' tolken to 'faux' token and viceversa (another form of exit-entry liquidity will be outlined later on in this white paper).
Competitions - 850,000 $DRPZ (4.47% of the remaining supply for a total of 19,000,000 Sugar $DRPZ) 


Inflationary Model:

1% Annual Inflation Rate - to make sure everyone has a chance of joining in on the fun later on and to help avoid any crazy pricing issues when the initial supply is fully distributed. 
Any tokens that are not used up from the marketing, development, and project funds after the first 5 years will be burned. This means that they are simply deleted which is positive for the project as it means that the cost per coin essentially becomes higher. This is usual practise for a lot of projects and is something people often like to see, much rather that than a project who just keeps printing themselves 'free money', on the contrary this model is quite the opposite- as anyone will be able to purchase these new tokens on the open market for themselves. Once the project hits the annual inflationary phase EverythingBitesized will stop buying up it’s own token with YouTube ad revenue and overall brand revenue  and let the existing community and newer members split the 1% between each other giving everyone a chance to get a modest stake in the project far into the future.


All members of the team are not allowed to purchase $DRPZ directly from the website as apposed to freely on the market (to negate any potential price manipulation between the ‘real’ and the ‘faux’ token arbitrage, more on that later..)

Members of the team will be given a decent % of their respective department's allocated budget BUT given to them over the space of a yearly contract in monthly installments so that no-one can wildly dump the token price on launch.

I have designed these token economics with both fairness and longevity in mind. Everything will be aboveboard and accounted for with full transparency where possible. Once the project has been fully rolled out (The Forum/Website) the clock starts ticking and the 5 year countdown begins. By the 5th year the project will be booming and news of the upcoming token burn will reflect positively on the price as people trade the token more knowing that it's value will increase 'overnight' as the misused tokens are burned out of the supply.

Ironically people usually ‘buy the rumor’ and sell once the event comes around so who knows where the price will go once the tokens are burned (if they are burned and as appropriate where outlined above and with community approval).

The 1% of total supply inflation per year works as easy as turning a tap on or off, but would be as serious an event as a bitcoin halving event which is interesting to note.
Scalability:
The inflationary model will be something that sticks out about this project- as most other projects are 'deflationary' by nature. Bitcoin for instance will only ever have 21,000,000 coins issued total with a hard cap on the total amount of coins that will be issued and cannot be changed unless there is a drastic miner consensus which means that as the supply dwindles the price will sky rocket and people new to crypto won't have a chance to get a decent stash/market share of the token. With an inflationary model everyone knows how much is going to be minted each year and new people will have a chance to join in and get more tokens leading to less 'whale' issues although 'whales' will always be prevalent in ANY financial market. It's a story as old as time itself, wealth gets stored up too much by too few a people, the majority (poor) get extremely pissed off and revolt against the rich and the wealth is redistributed only to then end up in the hands of another select few again.
 
With the token economics I have drawn up and outlined above and throughout this whitepaper I hope to combat at least some of these issues as much as humanly possible.

Technicals
 
One of the other 'problems' with Bitcoin is that it often has high transaction fees and slower transaction speeds. $DRPZ is on the Waves platform which solves both of the above issues, which means more scalability and ease of use; making it realistic for vendors to use the currency for transactions because it has 'instant' payments- unlike Bitcoin payments that can take upwards of 10 minutes and fees that can get INSANELY high especially when the network is congested and you just want to send a small amount but the fee is substantially larger than what you want to send. This can be very frustrating for users and impede or even fully stop someone from being able to use the blockchain as originally intended.

Because Bitcoin miners have to buy very expensive equipment to mine the currency, which quickly becomes obsolete, AND there is a hard cap on the total supply it will potentially become unfeasible for Bitcoin to perform economically in any stable kind of sense in the long-term future. This is because it uses what is called a 'proof of work' consensus where miners solve complex algorithms with their expensive hardware and electricity to prove that 'blocks' of transactions are legit and then stores them onto the publicly verifiable blockchain ledger for the funds to then be credited and debited to and from the right accounts.

Some of this is great, while some of it not so great. With $DRPZ I hope to keep the good while dealing with at least some of the bad. The Waves Network which is the platform that the $DRPZ token operates on is perfect for many reasons. One primarily being that it is still a legit tried and true blockchain with a public ledger (record of transactions and account balances) other reasons I am using the Waves network are as follows:

1. It is proof of stake rather than proof of work. This means that those who 'stake' their tokens (basically lock them into the network and save them) help keep the blockchain secure. They do so because they've got a vested interest in their ‘stake’ and keeping the blockchain operating smoothly and securely without malicious intent as to secure their OWN stash so their nodes are therefore trusted to ‘handle’ the blockchain and receive the block rewards for doing so. This is how transactions are confirmed on the Waves network and subsequently ours (Search on Google if you need more clarification on the differences between the two consensus models if you need to before you read on as for brevity’s sake, noob’s sake, and investor’s sake I have tried to avoid getting too technical and keeping it as fundamental as possible). 

2. Proof of stake also means that there is a negligible near zero impact on the environment which is pretty cool and there are also no mining pools which means more decentralization. This is much closer to the ‘1 CPU 1 VOTE’ vision Satoshi originally envisioned which is a philosophy I want to ring true on every fundamental level of this project, more on this later.

3. You can buy, trade, and hold tokens safely with just an email address and a password. This means that the project is a LOT more accessible to the general public (especially older and younger people alike) and those who are generally 'crypto naive'. This will help onboard people onto the project as the idea of looking after their own crypto will become a LOT less daunting. When you sign up to Waves you can set multiple forms of 2FA (Two Factor Authentication) to keep your account secure so it’s a good middle ground between safety and accessibility.

Users will be able to use their tokens to vote on changes to the project over time, get a discount on merchandise and discount on forum/website membership (read till the end to see more on the many more ways I am going to monetise EverythingBitesized and what privileges and perks the payed site members will get in their respective tiers). People will receive a hefty 30% discount on ANY product or service the platform offers if the sum is payed for in the native token. This will essentially force a captive audience situation where a person is strongly exposed to the project (and therefore crypto generally) and are willing to take what they see as a potential ‘risky first step’ for the sure reward of a 30% discount which, depending on what is being bought, could add up to a sizeable amount of change back in their pockets. Some more examples of the types of discounts people can get if they buy in and use the native token: 30% off early access to my content on YouTube and a discount on any product or service under the umbrella of Forge Fungus and it's parent company EverythingBitesized. (Much more on how general site monetization will work later on as well as getting even more in-depth about potential revenue streams at the end of the whitepaper).

All new projects of mine in the future that can or could have a token economics model installed inside of it you bet you'll find it in there. I have a TON of really cool ideas that will come to fruition over time as I get more and more capital to commission the projects and pay developers who want straight fiat $ rather than a prosective amount of the ttoken equivalent for their work.

The ultimate goal is to have a social media and content creation empire that will rival even the big name social media enterprises as well as give Netflix a run for their money to boot.This of course sounds ludicrous- probably entirely bombastic; but do read on. 

Sure, all this sounds great, if not overly ambitious, but how do we know you’ve got the grit? Well check out my YouTube channel and the amount of work I've put in, the results I’ve accomplished so far just as a start- and the analytics I’ve accomplished in just a year and a half. That coupled with an older experience of mine in ‘YouTubing’ a channel in the past that is in a HIGHLY niche category yet STILL got just under 10 million views before I stopped posting (Got demonetised for politically sensitive content, was talking about issues like Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein as well as predators in Hollywood before it was all big mainstream news, but alas, this project won’t have that issue as it’s a very universally appealing channel). 
Fundamentals 
If you go through my channel (There are well over 1,300 videos on there, most of YouTube’s focus is on my short form content for the time being but I consistently get thousands of views a week, sometimes a day), you’ll see that I'm not only serious about making all this a reality but capable too. I already make enough content released daily for people to digest and be satisfied with from their favourite channel AND some. That being said, once the Discord is a thriving hub of fellow content creators and the website is buzzing with people who are collaborating together or solely publishing their own work there will be the opportunity to stream people's work directly from our own servers in a subscription model like Netflix.

In this instance all 'premium' content made on the platform will become free to view and unlocked to anyone who is a registered user on the site BUT people who have a paid subscription will get access to that content a month in advance. People will also be able to subscribe to their own favourite content creators much like people can subscribe to you on Twitter and YouTube.

People will have to use $DRPZ on the website to order work commissions and be paid for their work/contributions. Any ad revenue generated by ads running alongside a persons content that person gets 50% of. Users will also be able to tip each other for whatever reason they want. This could look like someone giving a friend $DRPZ just for the sake of it or so their friend can purchase a membership on the site or because they really liked someone's content or for any reason they want.

The end goal is a website that serves as an alternative to other social media platforms and subscription streaming services while also serving as fertile ground for collaboration and commission/gigs requested by other users. There will be an escrow system for the commissions. How this is going to work will be: 

1. Someone requests a piece of work to be done.
2. Creators bid for the opportunity to accept the gig/
3. Former said someone then chooses who to pick for the job based on their price offer as well as their past content/portfolio and status in the community.
4. Once an agreement is reached between the creator and the customer the funds are put 'on hold' in escrow while the job gets completed.
5. If above said person/customer is happy with the work they tell the website this and the funds are automatically released to the creator. 
6. If the customer is not happy with the work completed and thinks it doesn't live up to the agreement or expectations originally agreed upon they can dispute the job and potentially get their money back.
7. Wherever the money goes depends on who the admin see's as right in the situation. Has the work been completed to a satisfactory level and in accordance with what the customer and creator agreed upon? If so then the funds are released to the creator. If there be a rather sloppy rush job done that is clearly not worth the funds or goes clearly against what was agreed upon then the funds will go back to the customer.

A rating system like uber has for instance will encourage people to perform work to a high quality. People will both be reviewed as good/bad customers and good/bad creators to balance things out and there will even be an honesty based system where people who leave reviews are ALSO reviewed FOR their reviews. For small amounts of $DRPZ deposited to their accounts trusted and verified members can look through gig transactions and outcomes and reviews on the platform and rate whether the reviewers feedback was fair or not this will help keep people honest on the site as they will accrue a bad score over time and look like the type of person you don't want hiring you or working for you if they don’t have good reviews or reviews OF reviews..

I want to use some of the development funds for making a portion of the site where there is a generic addictive arcade game with high scores that changes every month (think snake, tetris, flappybird etc) and there will be both daily, weekly AND monthly prizes for those who have the highest score in that given period. Their prize proceeds will come from the ad revenue generated on the page of the game. Every attempt at the high score after people 'die' or 'fail' they will be forced to watch a video ad between each attempt which will generate a great deal of revenue from people competitively trying for the high score and will make the prize a substantial sum that pays for itself. It’s a win-win-win (well, win-win-lose… counting the many people that don’t win the prizes, but the site and the winner both walk away with a tidy sum and those who lost got to have fun/compete and get the chance to win something substantial. This is a good loop of economics. The more people play the bigger the prizes the more people then play which then pushes the prize up even more which then draws in new people and the cycle repeats until people are winning stupid amounts and the website is generating a hefty sum just from this one web page/revenue stream. This will help keep the lights on and pay equity owners/partners/staff (myself included)- with.

As users contribute on the forums they will accrue small amounts of $DRPZ for engagement such as replies to other's posts, and likes but larger amounts will be given to those who get 'likes' and 'boosts' on the forum from original content creation. There will be a system in place to stop this from getting abused and receiving an incessant amount of spam tp the site. To start earning $DRPZ for engagement users will have had to have been a member of the website/forum for a month with at least one meaningful post every one of those days. This daily post in question has to be in some way relevant/thoughtful/meaningful to the original content it is in response to. Once they have been 'proven' as a genuine contributor or user they will then be able to begin accruing these $DRPZ which will be paid for by advertising revenue on the website.

Everything feeds back in on itself in a positive way here. Users are incentivized to use the platform because of the fundamentals alone and great content (Already existing in plentiful just from what I’ve contributed so far on my channel)  but with the chance to earn 'free' crypto just by engaging and communicating as they would do on any other platform they will be more inclined to be active on the site/forums and given all the above- people will be incentivised to prioritise their posts to be valuable and meaningful.

There will be ranked tiers in the forum based on the amount of engagement they have given into the site. This will be formulated by an algorithm based on a formula that takes into consideration the number of posts, replies, likes, reviews, votes etc and rounding it all up into either a positive or negative figure except it will be ‘Sweet’ or ‘Salty’ respectively.. This type of system will mean that over time the 'true' content creators and people invested (both financially and fundamentally long term) will shine brightly amidst the inevitable spammers and scammers just trying to get 'free' crypto by making pitiful replies and engagement just for the sake of the token. There will be some sort of ratio between the above factors that decides the overall score of the person in question and how ‘Sweet’ or ‘Salty’ they are displayed as on the forum.

There will be ranks and tiers that people can achieve through dedication and hard work on the site getting their score up to the required level. Instead of positive-negative or good-bad the site will deem people either sweet or salty. Every comment/thread/person on the site will have a sweet:salty ratio and the ‘tweets’ will be called ‘Sweets’. This sweet:salty ratio will follow them around on the entire site and will be able to be reviewed in-depth by any other user for some $DRPZ (Again paid for by advertising revenue on the site) again incentivising people on the platform to create decent and engaging content.

The vast majority of ad revenue generated by the site will either directly or indirectly go back to- or at least benefit the users/platform directly, or indirectly. 75% of the entire sites revenue will be used to buy up $DRPZ directly from the crypto markets (which, as a side note, will make people's tokens worth more) and distributed back into the project eco system to benefit both the project and the user.  This will help keep buy pressure on the token as well as incentivise people to help the site grow. The more website traffic the higher the ad revenue the higher the token price the higher the traffic and so on and so forth. 

This is how the site revenue distribution will probably look like (although this is yet to be clearly defined as I want the early community to have a say in this stuff as it is vital to the direction and trajectory of the project as well as it's economics and fundamentals):

25% will be used for an ad revenue sharing model. Paid members will all share the pot between them every day/week/month/year and perhaps sometimes the economics will work out to a point where paid members are getting their money back for paid membership AND some more on top depending on how much revenue the site generates. So there's the very real potential that someone will, say, buy a site membership for the relevant tier at $10 (for instance) then at the end of their billing period they've actually earned more from the revenue sharing program than they put in to take part in it. This sounds crazy but that's probably because it IS crazy. It's just one of the many reasons and incentivisations for people to take part in the community, and stay in it. 

25% will go towards stablising the ‘real’ token:‘faux’ token (more on this later) balance giving exit and entry liquidity to those who want to cash in or cash out of the site so there are no undue delays to their deposits or withdrawals. This will help keep things steady and ticking so there are less waiting times and less out of the ordinary price fluctuations and arbitrage between the 'two' respective tokens. This fund will keep growing every month as more and more ad revenue rolls in and will scale alongside new users entering the platform and if need be some funds can be diverted from here for other site uses without ANYONE losing out or having a worse off experience.

25% will be used for competitions as well as paying people to engage organically with the website via threads (posts) and replies as well as for reviews of users and reviews OF the reviewers reviewing other reviewer.. (that made sense, right?) This will not only build up people's token balances serving to incentivise people to post and react to more quality and engaging content/reviews but will also help keep spammers at bay as they will receive bad reviews on their low quality posts and will therefore receieve less visibility until they just give up and disappear with their account in the 'salty' status and reputation beyond repair (for the most part, of course some people will always come back and try to game the system when there's money involved).

The remaining 25% will be classed as the website's 'profit' and will go to paying early investors who paid for a stake in the brand as well as paying a respective portion to each team member based upon prior agreement or contract. I will be receiving at least 10% of this for myself to live on so I can not only keep working on the project with the lights switched on but also just to reward myself as owner of the project and having built it from the ground up.

Any excess that can 'safely' be taken out of the forever growing abovementioned 25% liquidity fund can be subject to use by site staff for any reason whatsoever with no need to consult the site members as it will not negatively impact them. This could include paying out more money to users and/or staff. This excess will give the site some breathing room to maneuver and place funds in the most appropriate places which will for the most part be put down to a democratic vote among team members then if there's no concensus it will be put down to a community vote.

At any point a user can deposit $DRPZ from the blockchain onto the site by sending it to a site wallet. They will then be issued the same amount of $DRPZ on the website eco-system once the transaction is confirmed by an admin. They can then use this respective balance on the website to do any or all of the above mentioned on-site utilities for the token.

Conversely, if a person wants to withdraw their balance from the site a request will be made for withdrawal, an admin will confirm it, and their ‘faux’ token balance from the website will be cleared however much the user requests to withdraw and the 'real' tokens on the blockchain will be sent to their designated address.

So this may seem confusing to a lot of people, especially the crypto naive so I'll try to break it down with an alice and bob scenario or two below. There is only 'one' token itself on the blockchain that can be freely traded/transacted/bought/sold on the exchange or between individual parties, or even saved long term. That is the 'main' token. The token used on the website is just a reflection of what balance you have on the blockchain so for example:

Alice buys 5 'faux' $DRPZ from the website directly for cash which are then available as her balance on the site to use in the the eco system. Alice uses 2 $DRPZ (example figure) to buy site membership. Alice tips out 2 more $DRPZ to other people on the website. Alice decides to then withdraw the remaining 1 $DRPZ to her wallet to trade openly and manage herself. That balance is then wiped off of the website and the 'real' token is sent to their respective wallet.

Bob buys 5 'real' tokens from the crypto market. Bob deposits said 'real' tokens into the website and then receives a 'faux' respective balance to use on the site for any of the above mentioned purchases. Bob then wants his remaining tokens back off the website and onto the blockchain and requests a withdrawal. The balance requested is wiped from the 'faux' token balance on the site and they are sent the respective 'real' token(s) to their blockchain wallet.

Using this 'real/faux' system is great for a number of reasons. One being that instead of the ENTIRE project and website running on the blockchain being expensive and resource intensive to run only the currency itself is on the blockchain. This makes development of the site MUCH easier as it's not restricted by a clunky blockchain to perform paid actions on the site. There will be hourly or even minutely snapshots of both the blockchain itself and the website token economy. If someone successfully hacks the project website to screw with who owns how many tokens to give themselves more tokens then the problem can be nipped in the bud by reverting back to the most recent snapshot of the blockchain/'site'chain and then we can rectify the issue (for the most part) by appropriating funds to the right people based off that. People WILL try to hack and exploit the site, this is only natural especially in a crypto project but they will NOT be able to hack the blockchain and the snapshot system will be set up on another (likely proof of work blockchain other than Waves itself) so that it cannot be manipulated and everything can be verified should there be any issues that arrise (issues probably will arrise, naturally) and keeps everything above board.

Having both the 'real' token on the blockchain as well as the snapshot of the 'faux' tokens on the website safe on another secure blockchain will help prevent loss of funds due to hackers at least on the site end. Users will be responsible for the safety of their own custodial tokens on the blockchain/in their wallets. If they lose access to their account that is their own responsibility and unfortunately some people will lose their funds due to being careless and forgeting their email/password to the Waves Network and not having access to their recovery method and/or being hacked due to poor digital hygeine).

This overall system I have proposed (especially regarding using the Waves platform for a multitude of reasons) is a good balance between usuability, scalability and security making it easy for new users and less intimidating while still staying as secure as is possible given the concept of the project. 

One of the projects I want to do on the website is called 'Sugar Gaming' and it's something I can only reveal to verified early investors who sign a non-disclosure agreement as it's such a great idea I don't want someone to steal it before I can make it happen. 
Needless to say this idea is a great idea in and of itself let alone when enveloped in all of the above economics and fundamentals.
 
The already EXISTING and succeeding project (my YouTube channel) is intimately tied with all of these plans outlined above. It’s already getting respectively successful and gaining secure and consistent traction quick. In the first year and a half of hard work I've gotten 1.3 million views and 1,150+ subscribers which is a GREAT start. I have an old channel that got nearly 10,000,000 million views so I do know what I'm doing, however. My newer project in question (EverythingBitesized) is showing all the hallmarks of success that my past channel did before it blew up.

My past channel (Breaking Truth) is highly 'niche' and specialised with a very small target audience but I STILL managed 44,000 subs and 10 million views. EverythingBitesized as a project has MUCH more potential reach. My older channel is about conspiracy theories from a Christian standpoint (so HIGHLY niche) yet EverythingBitesized is about.. well everything.
This gives me a MUCH wider audience to market to and onboard onto the project and into the ecosystem. I am rapidly approaching the point of an explosion in growth. Once my channel inevitably tick-tick booms it's going to bring a LOT of traffic to the community on the Discord/Reddit/Early Website-Forum where people will be able to participate in the free airDropZ of the currency as well as getting currency for sharing the project with other people. 

On my channel I have something for everyone as I have posted well over 1.3k videos in a year and a half (most of them comedic shorts which sometimes get upwards of 10k views each) but PLENTY of long format content that comes in many different flavours and sizes. I have everything from music videos, funny videos, educational videos, gaming videos, true crime videos, film reviews, artificial intelligence videos, documentary style videos, mental health videos, my own crappy music, and reaction videos. So something for the whole family, in fact I just started to target some of my content towards children.

I am making engaging educational content for students and kids that is also interesting enough for adults. To help keep things aboveboard and appropriate I have listed all my short videos as 18+ as well as my true crime videos and explicit music videos so that new kid viewers who subscribe to the kids content aren't showed something that is too mature for them.

Opening up to a children’s audience extends the reach and potential of the channel by magnitudes. Not only will I make engaging educational content for them but gaming content too and there will be kids/adults that both like each type of content keeping it as universal as possible.

Part of the reason my channel hasn't fully blown up yet (those 1.3 million views are NOTHING compared to what's to come) is because I’ve thrown so much provably engaging content at the algorithm YouTube is only just starting to dip it's toes into the waters of my content to see who to market it towards to best achieve the best amount advertising revenue for YouTube and myself as well as the best results for the advertiser. Once they figure out who the perfect audience is for all the different types of content on my channel and finds the right 'average' demographic user to market all the content to it will explode.

Currently I'm steadily getting thousands of views a week often 2k+ in one day. I show consistent and persistant growth across all boards. A 'good' view duration % to aim for on YouTube is between 70-80% (this is the amount of the video that the average person watches before clicking away) and that's a respectable figure for anyone to aim for. Most people will only get this level of engagement on some of their videos. I get it on practically ALL of my videos often seeing upwards of a well over 100% average view duration which is phenomenal. This is not just good this is amazing. This means that my content keeps people engaged and therefore makes for better ad 'slots' where a company pays more to advertise on my videos than other people's because mine keep viewers attention for longer and makes them more likely to be in an 'engaged' state of mind by the time they view an advert(s).

I want my YouTube channel to get to well over a million subscribers in the next five years and I fully believe I will achieve this, maybe sooner than anyone, including myself, would think. The channel is like a primed powerkeg just waiting to explode which then will in turn explode this project I’m outlining.


Any and all analytics of my current and past channel can be proven and verified as well as any claims made above. I promise I will not deviate from the token economics outlined above. If you read something anywhere else that is different for any reason it is trumped by what is written here. I will stick to the above token economics for the long haul only making any changes if the majority of the community proposes/votes for it. 

For instance some people might want an inflationary model of higher than 1% so that more people can get onboard and get involved whereas others may way a lower inflationary model or even a deflationary model like Bitcoin. People with 'unfair' amounts of the token will tend to opt for the latter whereas new users and long time supporters of the project will tend to opt for the former. I believe the former will win every time although there could well be a middle ground reached where the inflation rate is changed to suit both polarised sides of the same coin.

The website is ultimately going to be a democracy where users can pay a decent amount of $DRPZ to initialise a new campaign for people to vote on their idea or for a much smaller amount of $DRPZ people can cast a vote on said proposition. Development decisions will be almost entirely based on what the community wants except in circumstances where the decision may be deemed as 'harmful' to the project by qualified staff. An example of this may be someone proposes a new feature on the website, their proposal reaches a majority verdict on the sweet or salty side, and then the development team deem that the venture will open up too many security vulnerabilities or somehow damage the user experience or functionality of the site then an apology will be issued explaining to voters in-depth why their proposal and subsequent vote had to be negated in which case both the voters and the proposer will be refunded their $DRPZ back to do as they please with.

That's the beauty of this project in that it gives creators and viewers alike reasons to get involved in the economy and stimulate it. There are multiple instances outlined above where creators and viewers alike will strive to push the site's influence forward as there will be plenty of incentive for them to do so (especially for creators).

Airdrop recipients will need to verify themselves with KYC/Identification to qualify for the free (Yes, actually free) tokens from the respective fund. This will help avoid people spamming and abusing the system to get extra tokens although people will still abuse the system to some extent, naturally, as there's money involved and this is just something crypto communities have to deal with as best as they can.  


AirDropZ will come from the airdrop fund that makes up 52.63% of the entire supply and will take place at regular intervals (as of yet undetermined) over a long space of time (at least the five years until the remainder of tokens not yet distributed are burned, if any left to burn at all, and if the community says so). The goal is to have ALL of the airdrop supply distributed but not at the cost of some people having too much more than others or the supply drying up too fast as to ensure onboarding new users


Not satisfied yet I hear you say? How about not having to sign a non disclosure agreement and I just spill my beans.

Sugar Gaming is a concept I came up with a while ago I just don’t know how to code. My skills are more in the marketing realm and everything that goes with it. I need funds and a dev team (or one capable and beast dev who will commit themselves to the project)

The concept of Sugar Gaming is that it functions almost exactly like a dating app like Tinder (swipe right or left) but it’s primarily focused on finding people who play the same games and have the same general interests or occupations as you to game and socialize with. People will have a short bio including favourite games and a picture/avatar that people can swipe left or right on like Tinder.

”When a person sees a profile on their Tinder feed, they can swipe right to indicate that they are interested, or left to indicate that they are not interested. If both people slide to the right, they will be matched.” - Sugar Gaming will work exactly like this.

People will of course get longer bios on their profile and it will act sort of like a Twitter account where you can post ‘tweets’ but the Tweets will be called ‘Sweets’ (one per hour unless they’ve got a membership package) and they go to a global social network feed were everyone can see everything that everyone else has posted unless they block the person. This global functionality will help more people connect and the social media aspect will be more engaging. It will be especially helpful for when the site is in it’s infancy. It will be a basic social media network, as well as a ‘dating’ app to find matches to play favourite games with, it will be tied to my other project, my YouTube channel, and now this project also! 

There will also actually BE a dating element to the site where people can find E-Girlfriends and Boyfriends if they tick the ‘romantic’ box rather than the ‘gaming’ matchmaking box and choose from a list of options of the type of person they’re looking for and what games they need to be into and stuff like political leanings and religious status, as well as trivial stuff, etc. The dating aspect will work exactly like the plutonic aspect, but the plutonic side will be the main focus and default landing page for the site/app.

Below are some more details on how I want to monetise the project(s) and information about what the website membership tiers may look like:

There are unlimited swipes on the gaming/clan/dating element but you can get ‘Super Sweets’ which boosts your visibility.

The social media aspect will be interesting because it will be full of gamers and clans!

People will be able to make essentially what are like Facebook groups to create and manage their clans. There will be a matching aspect of the site/app to find suitable clans and for clans to find suitable applicants.

People will have to buy the native crypto currency to purchase different tiers of membership (Gold, Silver, Bronze) and each will come with added benefits and perks.

Imagine a place where it’s a social network and/or VBul forum where you can find like minded people to play the same games together that both people love. The goal is to get people to find gaming parters (romantic or otherwise) to play with for the rest of their life. Have you heard the expression “Foxhole brotherhood”? It basically means when you’re at war and in a foxhole with someone and bullets are zinging around you and artillery is bombarding your proximity and because of the insane stress you become very familiar with your ‘partner’ and garner a bond so strong it cannot be broken- for life. That’s what I want to achieve. At the end of the day most PVP games are basically simulated war so this will absolutely translate.

Eventually there will be mobile games that run both in browser, iOS and android that change every month for security. Whoever gets the top score for a respective period is granted the respective % of ad revenue generated for that page and the forced video ads for those time periods as outlined in greater dealer above.

There will be a forum for collaborating with other content creators and even commisioning work paid for with $DRPZ in escrow. Someone creates something for someone else and once that’s been confirmed by a member of staff the $DRPZ  are released but someone can dispute the commission if it’s not good enough then the funds are put back into escrow until an admin or mod reviews it and decides whether or not the work was completed to a satisfactory level and if it is the funds are released to the content creator, if not then the funds go back to the person who commissioned the artwork or whatever type of content.

People can commission everything from video editing to writing articles (or poems or letters or any type of written media) GFX design, help with YouTube’s backend (analytics, and descriptions or anything YouTube), background music for videos, voice overs, logo design, web design, social media content, marketing, advertising campaigns, branding, appearance on a podcast, cameos, lessons in anything, games, apps, private tutoring, trading advice or tips or practically anything within reason. 

All profiles will be able to hashtag the games they like and their hobbies and interests so that the site can matchmake better and even randomly suggest people who are almost a perfect match.

There will be competitions running constantly. Weekly competitions and monthly ones where the participants have to like and RT and subscribe to the post on Twitter outlining the rules and theme (if there is one). Competitions will be stuff like best short story, best poem, best piece of AI art, best meme, best video, etc)

There will be one top prize and two runner ups (Gold, Silver and Bronze) and the prize will be a portion of the ad revenue for that period of time (that the competitions runs for).

There will be ranks on the forum as follows;

Newbie (0-20 posts)
Lurker (50-100 posts)
Contributor (100-200 posts)
Super Contributor (500-1000)
Wise Guru (2000-3000)
Deadly Assassin (5000 - 10k)
1337 (10k+)
1337 PRO (100,000-500,000)


If you are interested in joining the team or investing or collaborating on something else or whatever else it may be you are welcome to reach me through any of the abovementioned avenues. As I said I won’t be active on the internet much till the end of the month I just wanted to post this here and see what you guys think so I can take some valuable feedback back to the project drawing board.

Even though this is still a concept it is fundamentally off to a GREAT start with my booming YouTube channel as it’s company brand.
